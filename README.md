# Rel-Event-(FYP)
Rel-event is an event recommendation and searching application which aims to has combine the latest influx of Natural Language processing and machine learning algorithms
to open doors for predictive analysis on event searches and popularity of an event.
In this of age of information, its problematic, time consuming, and frustrating to find information which is relevant to you and to your needs, 
especially in finding events that match your type around the city that you live in or visit.
This project aims to scrap live data from event websites and categorize those events into 6 different types such as 
Sports, Music, Food etc. There will be 2 types of users:
1. Customer
2. Organizer

As the Customer uses the application with time, it will learn the userâ€™s choices by saving user activity in database.
The engine will apply model-based recommendation and collaborative filtering to recommend events related to his/her personality choice.
As the Organizer, a user can predict the popularity/success of his event by entering details of the event he plans to market 
through sentiment analysis.
